        as a CS major and aspiring engineer, i have worked on a few key
        projects:

      <div class="port-sect">
        <h3>i-24 motion project</h3>
        <p class="port-dates">dates worked: august 2022 - present</p>
        <p>
          In the fall of 2022, I worked as part of the i-24 motion project,
          whose project link can be found
          <a href="https://i24motion.org/">here</a>. Within this position, I did
          quantitative data analysis of car trajectory data given from the
          hundreds of cameras installed over interstate 24, which runs through
          Nashville. These cameras capture millions of data points, each
          locating the position of each car within frame of the cameras. In the
          fall, I developed code to accomplish 5 main goals:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            calculate data on dynamics — speed and acceleration — on cars along
            with interstate, and generate basic statistics on these
          </li>
          <li>
            calculate data on lane occupation and changes — namely, where cars
            are occupied on the interstate and whether or not cars change lanes
          </li>
          <li>
            analyze conditional probability of lane change given acceleration
            and vice versa, to see the correlational relationship between the
            two variables. this is important for later analysis and predictions
            on when we might expect a lane change or an acceleration to aid with
            driver simulation.
          </li>
          <li>
            calculate the leader (car immediately in front) of a car as well as
            changes in leaders.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In spring of 2022, I will worked on producing scaleable, efficient
          code that will work on larger data sets at once to display calculated
          data on a centralized dashboard to show the lab's work to internal and
          external clients. To do this, I:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            utilized multi-threading to optimize the amount of time spent
            processing data by half!
          </li>
          <li>
            process data based on the above five goals, as well as trajectory
            lengths, vehicle types, etc. on hundreds of thousands of
            trajectories per document
          </li>
          <li>
            created a dashboard with animated plots from calculated data, where
            each snapshot is made from a sliding window approach to data
            processing
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>personal website</h3>
        <p class="port-dates">dates worked: december 2022 - present</p>
        <p>
          Over winter break, I attempted a beginner project I had thought about
          since i was 10 and envisioning myself as a celebrity: a personal
          website. Through free resources on stack overflow, Youtube, and the
          open web, I self-learned the basics of HTML and CSS and combined them
          to create a personalized website. This website was created on VSCode
          and consists of four webpages: a homepage with a button to contact me,
          an about page where I describe my personal and professional life, a
          portfolio (where you are right now!) describing previous work I have
          done, and a contact form page where users can submit their email,
          name, and message to me, and the form will email the link to me. The
          last was done with elementary PHP. In addition, there is a fully
          funcitoning navigation header bar on all four pages as well as a
          footer, each with working links/icons that can bring the user to
          another webpage or to my other links such as Github!
