# personal_website

this is my first attempt at making a website, and what better way to do it than a personal website? done over the first week of winter break of the 22-23 school year, this website is made from scratch using a variety of online guides, youtube videos, and trial and error. the two programming languages used are html and css, with a contact page made using the support of php as well.

within this website there are 4 tabs: a home page with a photo of me in the background with overlayed text and a contact button; an about me page with a brief introduction of my professional and personal life; a portfolio page that includes descriptions of my CS-related ventures; and a contact me page with a form that visitors can fill out to directly send to me. in addition, there is a header navigation bar that takes you to each of the four pages, and a footer that has icons that hyperlink to my instagram, linkedin, github, and email!
