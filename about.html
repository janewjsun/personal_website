              My name is Jane Sun, and I am a soon-to-be 20-year-old, originally
              from the Bay Area. My nuclear family consists of my mom Cindy,
              teenage brother Jacob, and dad Zheng, as pictured. As a family, we
              love to travel and immerse ourselves in local culture, watch
              action movies, discuss politics and current events, and take
              relaxing strolls. We moved around a lot throughout my childhood
              and eventually settled down in Beijing. I grew up in an
              international community and had the pleasure of meeting people
              from all over the world, allowing me to gain a lot of perspective
              and empathy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other than being a student, I am an avid crocheter and reader.
              Since the age of 5, I've created dozens of works, following my
              grandma's instructions, online tutorials, and more recently my own
              patterns. It started off as curiosity, but this hobby has thus
              turned into a way for me to tap into my creativity and produce
              something physical. I have been a huge bookworm since
              kindergarden, taking a brief break in my underclassmen years of
              high school but picking it back up during the pandemic. In 2022, I
              read 38, and I am aiming for 40 in 2023! My favorite genres are
              definitely mystery and romance, but I do enjoy a good science
              fiction or memoir every once in awhile.

            <p>
              I am a current Sophomore at Vanderbilt University, double majoring
              in computer science and psychology. This is quite a unique
              combination, and I want to eventually utilize skills learnd from
              both majors — technical programming and design skills from CS and
              an understanding of human thinking and decision-making — to go
              into differing applications of tech: data analytics; software
              engineering in fields of intersection between CS and social
              sciences; or product management. Currently, I am interested in
              program design and web development.
            </p>
            <p>
              In terms of programming skills, I have 2 years of experience with
              Python and 1.5 with C++, at an intermediate-to-advanced level of
              understanding with both. Additionally, I am a TA for CS2201:
              Program Design and Data structures, which is taught in Java, and
              thus have an intermediate understanding of this as well. Through
              self-learning via projects, I have also had exposure to HTML, CSS,
              and Javascript, along with APIs associated with Javascript, such
              as React or Node. These skills are still rapidly improving. My
              preferred languages remain to be Python and C++.
